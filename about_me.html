Fast forward 2 years and a half, and I built most the the projects that you see on my webpage. I think they are a testament to my desire and ability to pick up a new skill.

I have associate degrees in Behavioral Science, Sociology, and Humanities from Pasadena, California; not to mention my BSc. in Comp. Science. I am an academic researcher in the training. I am in graduate school, and I'm working with VR and AR in Unity. My focus is Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
